Initial_Portfolio_Project - NOTE: THE SITE HAS NOT BEEN MADE RESPONSIVE FOR SMALLER SCREENS

This repository contains all of the source files which I have created or used to make my first portfolio website.

HTML5 was used to the scructure the page well, within its coding conventions and guidelines, and CSS3 was used to achieve the style which I had in mind. JavaScript, its library jQuery and CSS3 was implemented to make certain elements interactive or animated. I also imported the GreenSock Animation Platform to make objects fade, bounce or float. To improve the overall performance of my website, I could have used GSAP's DrawSVGPlugin instead of jQuery's DrawSVG plugin. This would have increased loading speeds and would have made the website lighter.

When I was finished with styling and adding all of the necessary components to the html page, I decided to go for a more minimalistic look, therefore I did not make it compatible with smaller screens, such as mobile phones and tablets, but still thought the website was valuable enough to push it online. Comments have been added for easier maintenance and better navigation.
