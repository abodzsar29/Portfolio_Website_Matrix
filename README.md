Initial_Portfolio_Project - NOTE: THE SITE HAS NOT BEEN MADE RESPONSIVE FOR SMALLER SCREENS

This repository contains all of the source files which I have created or used to make a matrix themed portfolio website.

HTML5 was used to the scructure the page well, within its coding conventions and guidelines, and CSS3 was used to achieve the style which I had in mind. JavaScript, its library jQuery and CSS3 was implemented to make certain elements interactive or animated. I also imported the GreenSock Animation Platform to make objects fade, bounce or float.

Finally, I decided to go with a more minimalistic look, therefore I did not finish this page. This resulted in incompatibility with smaller screens, such as mobile phones and tablets, and higher resolution screens such as 2560 * 1440 or 3840 * 2160, but still thought the website was valuable enough to push it online. Comments have been added for easier maintenance and better navigation.
